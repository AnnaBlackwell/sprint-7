<h1>Lessons about making websites accessible for users with cognitive disabilities and why it's important:</h1>

Best practice for cognitive web accessibility includes:

1. Assistive Technology Compatibility. Content must be perceivable to assistive technology such as screen readers, by including appropriate alt test, form labels, table headers, logical heading structure, links that make sense out of context, a logical and intuitive order, full keybourd accessibility, and captions/transcripts.
2. Consistency. Navigation and interface elements should be consistent throughout a site.
3. Transformability. This means texts and images should remain readable when enlarged. Don't rely on colours to convey meaning.
4. Multi-modality. Use closed-captions and/or transcripts for video and audio content. Pair icons or graphics with text.
5. Focus and structure. Make it easy to focus user attention by using white space, avoiding distractions (e.g. animations, complex fonts), avoiding overuse of stylilstic elements (e.g. bold) for important content, organising content clearly using headings and lists, and avoiding background sounds.
6. Readability and language. Use simple language, stick to the content, use correct grammar and spelling, expand abbreviations and acronyms, and be succinct.
7. Orientation and error prevention/recovery. Give users instructions for forms, give clear error messages, give clear feedback on a user's actions, and allow critical functions to be confirmed, cancelled or reversed. Provide large clickable targets.

People with cognitive and learning disabilities represent the largest group of disabilities, so improving web accessibility for this audience will improve accessibility for everyone.
