Cognitive load is the amount of information the brain is processing at any given timepoint. When cognitive load exceed's a user's ability to process the information, a user may get overwhelmed, take longer to understand the information, or abandon the task.

Explain how you can or will update your own website to acount for and minimise cognitive straing. What did you change? Does this improve usability?

Ways to reduce cognitive load and increase usability include:
1. Avoiding visual clutter (images and links that don't add value)
2. Build on existing mental models (use common layouts etc)
3. Offload tasks - look for alternatives for requiring a user to read, remember or decide on something, by displaying previously-entered information, using images, or setting smart defaults.
